//! `IdP` provider-plugin contract.
//!
//! Public contract that deployment-specific `IdP` plugins implement and
//! that AM consumes through `ClientHub`. The trait carries two
//! tenant-lifecycle methods ([`IdpPluginClient::provision_tenant`],
//! [`IdpPluginClient::deprovision_tenant`]) and three user-lifecycle
//! methods ([`IdpPluginClient::provision_user`],
//! [`IdpPluginClient::deprovision_user`],
//! [`IdpPluginClient::list_users`]) — together with the
//! request / result / failure shapes they exchange. Every method
//! ships a default impl that returns the `UnsupportedOperation`
//! variant for its category so deployments that ship a partial
//! adapter (e.g. tenant-only or user-only) only need to override the
//! methods they implement.
//!
//! There is no separate availability probe: `provision_tenant` IS the
//! readiness signal. Plugins MUST return
//! [`IdpProvisionFailure::CleanFailure`] for failures that proved no
//! `IdP`-side state was retained, and [`IdpProvisionFailure::Ambiguous`]
//! for uncertain outcomes. AM's saga handles retry vs reaper-deferral
//! per variant.
//!
//! The trait runs **outside** any database transaction — the
//! provisioning step is an external side effect that must not hold
//! locks in `tenants`.
//!
//! # Plugin-private metadata
//!
//! AM is a stateful echo proxy for plugin-owned per-tenant data.
//! [`IdpProvisionResult::metadata`] is an opaque blob the plugin returns
//! on successful provisioning; AM persists it in `tenant_idp_metadata`
//! keyed by `tenant_id` and replays it on every subsequent `IdP` call
//! for that tenant via [`crate::idp_user::IdpTenantContext::metadata`]
//! and [`IdpDeprovisionTenantRequest::tenant_context`]. AM does NOT
//! interpret, validate, or namespace the value — the plugin owns the
//! shape entirely. Size is capped at the AM service boundary.
//!
//! # Failure model
//!
//! The `Ok` variant of `provision_tenant` carries optional opaque
//! metadata produced by the provider, which AM persists alongside the
//! `active` status flip. The `Err` variant is a [`IdpProvisionFailure`]
//! discriminating between:
//!
//! * [`IdpProvisionFailure::CleanFailure`] — AM can prove no `IdP`-side
//!   state was retained (connection refused before send, 4xx from the
//!   provider with a contract-defined "nothing retained" semantic).
//!   AM runs the compensating TX, deletes the `provisioning` row, and
//!   surfaces an AIP-193 `ServiceUnavailable` (HTTP 503).
//! * [`IdpProvisionFailure::Ambiguous`] — transport failure / timeout /
//!   5xx where the provider may or may not have retained state. AM
//!   leaves the `provisioning` row for the provisioning reaper to
//!   compensate asynchronously and surfaces `Internal` (HTTP 500). Not
//!   retry-safe without reconciliation.
//! * [`IdpProvisionFailure::UnsupportedOperation`] — the provider
//!   signalled that the requested provisioning cannot be performed at
//!   all. AM surfaces `Unimplemented` (HTTP 501); compensation rules
//!   match the `CleanFailure` path (nothing was ever written
//!   provider-side).
//!
//! The `provider_detail` strings carried by the failure variants are
//! routed through AM's redaction pipeline before reaching public
//! envelopes (see the impl-side `From<IdpProvisionFailure>
//! for DomainError` boundary in `cyberware-account-management::domain::idp`).
//! Plugin authors do not need to redact themselves — they pass the
//! raw vendor text and AM owns the public-surface mapping.
//!
//! See [`crate::idp_user`] for the user-operations DTOs forwarded
//! into the same trait's user-side methods.

/// (`for_bootstrap` / `for_provisioning_reaper` / `for_retention_sweep`
/// / `for_user_cleanup` / `for_user_groups_cascade` / `for_module_init`);

/// to a system credstore path. This is an AM-local convention, not a

/// in background flows MAY adopt their own (`<module>_system_context`)
/// pending a `modkit-security` canonical helper.
///
/// # Retry, backoff, and rate-limiting are owned by the plugin
///
/// AM does NOT wrap calls into this trait in retry loops, exponential
/// backoff, jittered scheduling, or circuit-breakers. Each AM call
/// site issues exactly one invocation per logical attempt:
///
/// * `provision_tenant` — one call per `create_tenant` saga.
/// * `deprovision_tenant` — at most one call per claimed row per
///   tick (both `hard_delete_batch` and `reap_stuck_provisioning`
///   take a 600-second DB lease before invoking the plugin so two
///   replicas cannot simultaneously call for the same tenant).
/// * `provision_user` / `deprovision_user` / `list_users` — exactly
///   one call per public REST request (or sibling SDK consumer).
///
/// Plugins MUST own their transport-level resilience: retries with
/// vendor-appropriate backoff, ratelimit handling, circuit breaking
/// after sustained failure, and any client-side dedup. A `Retryable`
/// return value signals that the plugin has exhausted its own retry
/// budget for this call; AM defers the row to the next reaper /
/// retention tick (default 30 s and 60 s respectively) and re-issues
/// from scratch. A misbehaving plugin that does not ratelimit will
/// see a steady periodic call rate (one per tick), not a thundering
/// herd — but the call frequency is the plugin's to manage.
///
/// # No silent no-op on mutating calls
///
/// `provision_tenant`, `deprovision_tenant`, `provision_user`, and
/// `deprovision_user` MUST NOT silently no-op. A provider that
/// cannot perform a mutating operation MUST return the
/// `UnsupportedOperation` variant for its failure category so AM
/// surfaces `idp_unsupported_operation` (HTTP 501) per PRD section
/// 5.5 and DESIGN section 3.8.
///
/// # Idempotency by error-mapping
///
/// Plugins do NOT need to silently no-op on already-removed tenants.
/// Instead they MUST surface vendor-side "tenant does not exist"
/// responses as [`IdpDeprovisionFailure::NotFound`] (typically HTTP 404
/// or 410 from the vendor SDK). AM's pipelines treat `NotFound` as
/// success-equivalent and proceed with the local DB teardown,
/// emitting an `outcome=already_absent` metric so the operational
/// signal stays observable. This shifts the "is this a re-call?"
/// interpretation from the plugin to AM — plugins map vendor errors
/// 1:1, AM business logic decides what each error means.
///
/// The user-side `deprovision_user` is intentionally simpler:
/// returning `Ok(())` is enough whether the `IdP` actually removed
/// the user on this call or the user was already absent. AM does
/// not distinguish the two cases (no reaper-style counter
/// equivalent exists on the user side; the audit log records the
