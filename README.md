**Cyber Ware** is a secure, modular XaaS development framework and middleware developed by the **Cyber Fabric Foundation**. It provides ready-to-use building blocks, domain components, and APIs with defense-in-depth, multi-tenancy, and granular access control built into every layer.

Cyber Ware is not a ready-to-use service. Instead, it is a set of well-integrated libraries and modules that XaaS vendors can compose into their own products. Vendors decide which modules to include, how to combine them into services, and where to run them—from edge devices to Kubernetes clusters.

Cyber Ware modules span three broad categories: **Core** modules for platform foundations such as API gateway, authentication/authorization, account management, etc; **Serverless** modules for functions, workflows, and event-driven execution; and **GenAI** modules for chat, retrieval, prompt orchestration, and related AI capabilities.

See [MODULES](docs/MODULES.md) for modules overview.

**Five defining Cyber Ware characteristics:**

1. **Secure XaaS framework with defense-in-depth** — Every API handler enforces authentication, authorization, tenant isolation, and scoped DB access by default. Security is structural, not opt-in, validated at build time using integrated dynamic lints.

2. **Three-tier module hierarchy** — *Modkit* (`libs/` — ModKit, DB access, error model, API middleware), *System modules* (`modules/system/` — API gateway, authn/authz, tenancy, resource groups, type registry), and *Service modules* (`modules/` — serverless runtime, GenAI subsystems, event system, and domain modules).

3. **Composable libraries, vendor-controlled deployment** — Each module owns its API surface and database, communicates via a Rust-native SDK that facades local vs. remote calls, and is fully infrastructure-agnostic. Vendors choose which modules to bundle and whether to deploy single-process (edge/on-prem), multi-node (bare metal), or on Kubernetes.

4. **Pre-integrated XaaS backbone** — Deep integration with multi-tenancy, licensing and quota management, usage collection, and event systems. Cyber Ware provides its own backbone modules, but each can be replaced or integrated with existing vendor infrastructure via plugins (e.g. subscription management, product catalog, provisioning, or license enforcement).

5. **Extensible domain model via Global Type System** — Modules expose extensible domain objects whose metadata and types are customizable through [GTS](https://github.com/globaltypesystem/gts-spec) — define new event types, user settings, LLM model attributes, etc. CRUD API handlers support customization via hooks and callbacks as serverless functions and workflows.

**Engineering principles:**
- **Spec-Driven Development**: [Specification templates](docs/spec-templates/README.md) (PRD, Design, ADR, Feature) define what gets built *before* code is written. Every module is well documented.
- **Shift Left**: Custom [dylint](tools/dylint_lints/) architectural lints enforce design rules at compile time, alongside Clippy, [tests](#testing), fuzzing, and security audits in CI
- **Quality First**: 90%+ test coverage target with unit, integration, E2E, performance, and security testing
- **Core in Rust**: Compile-time safety, deep static analysis including project-specific lints, so more issues are prevented before review/runtime
- **Monorepo**: Core modules and contracts in one place for atomic refactors, consistent tooling/CI, and realistic local build + E2E testing

See the full architecture [MANIFEST](docs/ARCHITECTURE_MANIFEST.md) for more details, including rationales behind Rust and Monorepo choice.

See also [REPO_PLAYBOOK](docs/REPO_PLAYBOOK.md) with the registry of repository-wide artifacts (guidelines, rules, conventions, etc).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust stable with Cargo ([Install via rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- Protocol Buffers compiler (`protoc`):
  - macOS: `brew install protobuf`
  - Linux: `apt-get install protobuf-compiler`
  - Windows: Download from https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases
- MariaDB/PostgreSQL/SQLite or in-memory database

### CI/Development Commands

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone --recurse-submodules <repository-url>
cd cyberware-rust

make build      # Build libraries and example server binary
make test       # Run tests
make example    # Run modkit example module
```

### Running the Server

Cyber Ware repository comes with an example server illustrating the modules APIs:

```bash
# Run an example server, see the API docs @ http://127.0.0.1:8087/cw/docs
make exammple

# See API documentation:
# $ make example
# visit: http://127.0.0.1:8087/cw/docs

# Check if server is ready (detailed JSON response)
curl http://127.0.0.1:8087/cw/health

# Kubernetes-style liveness probe (simple "ok" response)
curl http://127.0.0.1:8087/healthz
```

Other quick start examples:

```bash
# Option 1: Run with SQLite database (recommended for development)
cargo run --bin cyberware-example-server -- --config config/quickstart.yaml run

# Option 2: Run without database (no-db mode)
cargo run --bin cyberware-example-server -- --config config/no-db.yaml run

# Option 3: Run with mock in-memory database for testing
cargo run --bin cyberware-example-server -- --config config/quickstart.yaml --mock run
```

### Example Configuration (config/quickstart.yaml)

```yaml
# Cyber Ware Configuration

## Security

Cyber Ware applies defense-in-depth security across the entire development lifecycle — from Rust's compile-time safety guarantees and custom architectural lints, through compile-time tenant isolation and PDP/PEP authorization enforcement, to continuous fuzzing, dependency auditing, and automated security scanning in CI.

See **[Security Overview](docs/security/SECURITY.md)** for the full breakdown, including: Secure ORM with compile-time tenant scoping, authentication/authorization architecture (NIST SP 800-162 PDP/PEP model), 90+ Clippy deny-level rules, custom dylint architectural lints, cargo-deny advisory checks, ClusterFuzzLite continuous fuzzing, CodeQL/Scorecard/Snyk/Aikido scanners, and AI-powered PR review bots.

## FIPS 140-3 support

Cyber Ware builds with `--features fips` route every TLS data-path cryptographic operation through a **FIPS 140-3 validated cryptographic module**, on a single `rustls 0.23` state machine with one of three pluggable backends:

| Target | Validated module | Backend |
|---|---|---|
| Linux (x86_64, aarch64) | AWS-LC FIPS Provider (CMVP cert **#4816**) | `aws-lc-fips-sys` via `rustls/fips` |
| macOS (any arch) | Apple `corecrypto` User-Space Module (per-OS-version CMVP cert) | `cyberware-rustls-corecrypto-provider` over Security.framework + CommonCrypto |
| Windows (x86_64) | Microsoft Windows CNG (per-OS-version CMVP cert) | `rustls-cng-crypto` over `bcrypt.dll` |

```sh
cargo build -p cyberware-example-server --features fips
```

This is *"uses FIPS-validated cryptography"* — Cyber Ware itself is not on the CMVP Validated Modules list; the validated modules belong to Apple, AWS Labs, and Microsoft.

See **[Security Overview §9](docs/security/SECURITY.md#9-cryptographic-stack--fips-140-3)** for the full per-OS detail (algorithm scope, build prerequisites, verification gates, runtime OE-validation, dep-graph policy, what is and is not covered). Architecture, ecosystem constraints, alternatives we rejected, and per-OS rationale live in the **[FIPS PRD](docs/security/fips/PRD.md)** and the ADRs in [`docs/security/fips/adrs/`](docs/security/fips/adrs/).

export CYBERFABRIC_LOGGING_DEFAULT_CONSOLE_LEVEL="debug"
```

## Testing

```bash
make check           # full quality gate (fmt + clippy + test + security)
```

Other tests:

```bash
make test            # unit tests (workspace)
make test-sqlite     # integration tests (SQLite, no external DB required)
make e2e-local       # end-to-end tests (builds + starts server automatically)
make e2e-docker      # end-to-end tests (builds + starts server in Docker)
make coverage-unit   # unit test code coverage
make fuzz            # fuzz smoke tests (30 s per target)
```

On **Windows** (no `make`), use the cross-platform CI script directly:

```bash
python tools/scripts/ci.py check          # full CI suite
python tools/scripts/ci.py e2e-local      # end-to-end tests
python tools/scripts/ci.py fuzz --seconds 60  # fuzz smoke run
```

For the complete test strategy, coverage policy, CI pipeline details, and all
available commands see **[docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md)**.
