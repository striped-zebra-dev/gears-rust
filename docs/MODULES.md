# CONVENTIONS

## Versioning conventions

This document describes the CyberFabric Server components and their roles in typical scenarios. Every feature or scenario step has an inline indicator of the priority/phase tag (p1-p5) and implementation status of given functionality:

- [ ] - not implemented
- [x] - implemented

The objective of such notation is to provide a clear overview of the current state of the codebase and the next priorities of selected scenarios.

## Type System

CyberFabric Server uses the [Global Type System](https://github.com/GlobalTypeSystem/gts-rust) ([specification](https://github.com/GlobalTypeSystem/gts-spec)) to implement a powerful **extension point architecture** where virtually everything in the system can be extended without modifying core code.

The GTS naming conventions provide simple, human-readable, globally unique identifier and referencing system for data type definitions (e.g., JSON Schemas) and global data instances (e.g., JSON objects).

# ARCHITECTURE

## Detailed Overview

![architecture.drawio.png](img/architecture.drawio.png)

The diagram above illustrates the principal CyberFabric module architecture. The deployed component set depends on the target environment and build configuration; for example it can be a single executable for the desktop build or multiple containers for a cloud server.

Each module encapsulates a well-defined piece of business logic and exposes **versioned contracts** to its consumers via Rust-native interfaces, HTTP APIs, or gRPC. In addition, modules can define their own **plugin interfaces** that allow pluggable implementations of processing and storage concerns, enabling extensibility without coupling core logic to concrete backends. Additionally, modules can define **adapter interfaces** for compile-time selection of an implementation.

All interaction between modules and between modules and their plugins happens strictly through these versioned public interfaces. No module or plugin is allowed to depend on another module’s internal structures or implementation details. This enforces loose coupling, enables independent evolution and versioning, and allows modules or plugin implementations to be replaced without impacting the rest of the system.

## Modules Categories

All modules can be divided into several categories:
- **API Ingress** - the public ingress layer for external traffic; currently represented by API gateway
- **Business Logic Modules** - modules implementing the main SaaS service logic built on top of CyberFabric
- **Gen AI Modules** - foundational generative AI capabilities such as chat, model management, agents, memory, search, crawling, scheduling, and MCP integration
- **Serverless** - functions/workflows, runtimes, durable state, settings, and cluster coordination modules
- **Core Functionality** - shared platform capabilities such as audit, usage collection, jobs, registries, file handling, quotas, notifications, analytics, and approvals
- **Core Platform Integration Modules** - interfaces for other modules and adapters for real Core Platform services (see below)
- **Core Platform Services** - external services that implement Core Platform functionality, such as tenancy management, access policies, licensing, credentials, and outbound egress control

The **Core Platform Integration Modules** layer abstracts integration with core platform services, such as IdP, policy management, licensing, and credentials management that is out of scope of CyberFabric. This keeps CyberFabric reusable: it can run as a standalone platform, or it can integrate into an existing enterprise platform by wiring adapters to the platform’s services.

## Dependency rules
- Authentication/authorization: all **external HTTP** traffic is enforced by `api-gateway` middleware, and secure ORM access is scoped by `SecurityContext`. In-process calls must propagate `SecurityContext` and use SDK/clients; bypassing middlewares is not permitted for gateway paths.
- Business Logic Modules MAY depend on Gen AI Modules, Serverless modules, and Core Functionality modules through stable contracts
- Gen AI Modules MAY depend on Serverless modules and Core Functionality modules
- Only integration/adapters talk to external components
- No “cross-category sideways” deps except through contracts.
- No circular dependencies allowed

## API Ingress

API Gateway is the single public entry point into CyberFabric for all external clients. It terminates protocols, exposes versioned REST APIs with OpenAPI documentation, and applies a consistent middleware stack for authentication, authorization hooks, rate limiting, validation, and observability. API Gateway is responsible for request shaping and policy enforcement, but contains no business logic.

Once a request is validated, it is routed to the appropriate module via stable contracts. All domain decisions and state changes occur downstream, allowing gateway to remain simple, auditable, and scalable while internal modules evolve independently.

Every external request MUST pass through:
API Gateway → Auth Resolver → Policy Manager → License Resolver → Execution Module → Tenant Resolver → Audit / Usage Collector → Response

### API Gateway
#### Responsibility
Provide the single public API entrypoint for CyberFabric, including request routing, auth hooks, versioned REST surface, and OpenAPI publication.
#### High Level Scenarios
- [x] p1 - route versioned HTTP APIs to modules and expose OpenAPI
- [x] p1 - enforce request limits, timeouts, and basic middleware

## Business Logic Modules

**Business Logic Modules** are the primary user-facing SaaS capabilities built on top of CyberFabric. They compose Gen AI Modules, Serverless modules, Core Functionality modules, and Core Platform integrations into domain-specific product workflows while keeping product semantics isolated from shared platform infrastructure.

The architecture diagram uses placeholder business modules `A-E` to illustrate that multiple independent product domains can coexist on the same platform contracts. Each business module owns its domain models, user journeys, and business rules, while shared platform modules provide reusable execution, AI, governance, and integration capabilities.

## Gen AI Modules

**Gen AI Modules** provide the core AI capabilities of CyberFabric and represent the primary value layer for building AI-powered SaaS applications. These modules encapsulate domain-specific GenAI functionality such as conversational orchestration, model inference, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), agent execution, prompt management, and tool invocation. They are responsible for transforming user intent and contextual data into AI-generated outputs while enforcing platform-level constraints such as tenancy, security, policy, and usage limits.

These modules are designed to be highly composable and extensible: they rely on Serverless and Core Functionality modules (e.g., settings, jobs, usage collection, audit) and integrate with external AI providers or local runtimes through well-defined gateways. Gen AI Modules do not directly manage enterprise governance concerns (licensing, identity, credentials); instead, they delegate those responsibilities to shared platform modules and core platform adapters to remain focused on AI behavior and orchestration logic.

### Execution flow overview
1. Chat Engine / API-triggered entry
2. Configuration & assets (Settings Service, Prompts Registry, Models Registry)
3. Retrieval & discovery (Web Search Gateway, URL Crawler, Local Search Index)
4. Execution & tools (LLM Gateway, MCP Registry, Model Provider Controller)
5. Agent orchestration (AI Agents Registry, Serverless Gateway, Serverless Runtimes)
6. Persistence & feedback (Agent Memory, Usage Collector, Audit)

The principal diagram visualizes the primary Gen AI modules. `Prompts Registry`, `Model Runtime Controller`, and `Local Search Index` are supporting modules kept in this document even though they are omitted from the top-level diagram for readability.

## Core Platform Integration Modules

**Core Platform Integration Modules** provide a thin abstraction layer between CyberFabric and external or enterprise-grade platform services such as identity providers, license managers, credential stores, and outbound traffic governance systems. These modules expose minimal, stable interfaces that CyberFabric modules can depend on without being coupled to a specific vendor, protocol, or deployment environment.

The primary role of these adapter modules is decoupling: they allow CyberFabric to operate either as a standalone platform (using local implementations) or as a component embedded into a larger enterprise ecosystem. Adapter modules do not own authoritative state or business rules; instead, they translate CyberFabric’s internal contracts into calls to external core platform services, handling protocol adaptation, caching, and integration-specific concerns.

### Tenant Resolver
#### Responsibility

## Core Platform Services

Core Platform Services are authoritative, enterprise-level services that may exist outside of CyberFabric and act as systems of record for critical governance domains such as accounts, identity, access policies, licensing, credentials, and outbound egress control. These components typically belong to an organization’s broader platform or SaaS ecosystem and may already be deployed, certified, and governed independently of CyberFabric.

CyberFabric does not aim to be the system of record for these capabilities at enterprise level, but allows to integrate with external components operating in an integrated environment. It relies on adapter modules to interact with these external components through well-defined contracts. This approach allows CyberFabric to inherit enterprise-grade security, compliance, and governance guarantees while remaining portable, reusable, and safe to embed into existing platforms without duplicating or conflicting with core business infrastructure.

### Account Manager

- [ ] p2 - hierarchical multi-tenancy
- [ ] p2 - link tenants to identities and organizations
- [ ] p3 - account lifecycle (suspend, soft-delete, hard-delete, archive, move)
- [ ] p4 - map external tenant IDs to internal IDs

# SCENARIOS EXAMPLES

## Sub-scenario - incoming API call processing

This diagram reflects the **actual middleware stack** from `api-gateway` (see `apply_middleware_stack` in `modules/system/api-gateway/src/lib.rs`).

**Middleware execution order (outermost → innermost):**
1. Request ID (SetRequestId + PropagateRequestId)
2. Trace span (tower-http TraceLayer)
3. Timeout (30s default)
4. Body limit
5. CORS (if enabled)
6. MIME validation
7. **Rate limiting** (per-route RPS + in-flight semaphore)
8. Error mapping (converts errors to RFC-9457 Problem)
9. **Auth** (JWT validation → RBAC check → build SecurityContext with tenant from claims)
10. Policy engine injection
11. **License validation** (checks `license_requirement` from OperationSpec)
12. Router → Handler

## Sub-scenario - chat hook invocation

Chat hooks allow integrations to intercept internal message/file/search traffic within the chat system. Hooks enable:
- **Blocking**: Return error and stop processing
- **Override**: Modify content before proceeding

### Hook types

| Hook ID | Trigger point | Capabilities | Use case |
|---------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| `gts.x.genai.flow.hook.v1~x.genai.chat.user_message_pre_store.v1~` | After user message submitted, before DB store | BLOCK, OVERRIDE | DLP: scan outgoing content |
| `gts.x.genai.flow.hook.v1~x.genai.file.post_parse.v1~` | After file content parsed | INFORMATIVE | Audit, classification |
| `gts.x.genai.flow.hook.v1~x.genai.llm.pre_call.v1~` | Before final message goes to LLM | BLOCK, OVERRIDE | Content filtering, PII redaction |
| `gts.x.genai.flow.hook.v1~x.genai.llm.post_response.v1~` | After LLM response, before DB store | BLOCK, OVERRIDE | Response filtering |
| `gts.x.genai.flow.hook.v1~x.genai.search.pre_request.v1~` | Before search request (RAG or WebSearch) | BLOCK, OVERRIDE | Query sanitization |
| `gts.x.genai.flow.hook.v1~x.genai.search.post_response.v1~` | After search response received | BLOCK, OVERRIDE | Result filtering |

All the hook types are registered in GTS and can be enabled/disabled per tenant/user by customers or integrations. All the registered hooks will be executed in the priority order.

### Hook payload examples

**user_message.pre_store:**
```json
{
  "hook_type": "gts.x.genai.flow.hook.v1~x.genai.chat.user_message_pre_store.v1~",
  "payload": {
    "message_id": "msg_123",
    "content": "Please analyze this financial report",
    "attachments": [{"file_id": "file_456"}]
  },
  "context": {"tenant_id": "...", "user_id": "...", "conversation_id": "..."}
}
```

**llm.pre_call:**
```json
{
  "hook_type": "gts.x.genai.flow.hook.v1~x.genai.chat.llm_pre_call.v1~",
  "payload": {
    "messages": [...],
    "tools": [...],
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "estimated_tokens": 4500
  },
  "context": {"tenant_id": "...", "conversation_id": "..."}
}
```

## Typical chat scenario with ASYNCHRONOUS file attachment processing

> NOTE: This is target architecture and not the current state of the codebase. Some components and scenarios steps are not yet implemented.

This scenario follows patterns from **LangChain/LangGraph** (agent loop, state machine) and **Rig** (Rust AI framework):
- **ReAct pattern**: Reason → Act → Observe loop for tool calls
- **Streaming-first**: SSE for real-time token delivery
- **Async file processing**: Background jobs for parsing/indexing

**Steps:**
1. User uploads file + sends message (file stored, job enqueued) — **Hook: user_message.pre_store**
2. File processed asynchronously (parse → chunk → embed → index) — **Hook: file.post_parse**
3. RAG retrieval from indexed documents — **Hooks: search.pre_request, search.post_response**
4. WebSearch for real-time information (if enabled) — **Hooks: search.pre_request, search.post_response**
5. Agent state preparation (tools + prompt + model + token budget) — **Hooks: llm.pre_call**
6. Agent loop + SSE streaming — **Hooks: llm.pre_call, llm.post_response**

### Step 1/6 - Upload file + send message (async processing)

File upload stores the blob, then **Chat Engine orchestrates** job creation. The UI tracks job progress via SSE or polling before proceeding.

**Key architectural points:**
- API gateway remains simple (middleware + routing only)
- **Chat Engine** owns orchestration — it triggers the **Jobs Manager**
- UI must wait for job completion before file content is usable

```mermaid

  participant U as User
  participant C as Client UI

  box "CyberFabric"
    participant I as API gateway
    participant FS as File Storage
    participant CE as Chat Engine
    participant HK as Hook invocation
    participant JM as Jobs Manager
    participant DB as Chat DB
    participant EB as Events Broker
  end

  U->>C: Attach file + type message

  Note over C,FS: [ ] p2 - Step 1a: Upload file (store blob only)
  C->>I: POST /files/v1/upload (multipart, SecurityContext)
  I->>FS: Store blob (tenant_id, content_hash)
  FS-->>I: file_id, size, mime_type
  I-->>C: 201 Created {file_id, size, mime_type}

  Note over C,CE: [ ] p1 - Step 1b: Create chat message + trigger ingestion
  C->>I: POST /chat/v1/conversations/{conv_id}/messages
  Note right of C: {content: "Analyze this document", attachments: [{file_id}]}
  I->>CE: Create user message (SecurityContext)

  Note over CE,HK: [ ] p2 - HOOK: user_message.pre_store (see hook sub-scenario)
  CE->>HK: Invoke hook (user_message.pre_store, {content, attachments})
  HK-->>CE: {action: allow | block | override}
  alt action == "block"
    CE-->>I: 422 Unprocessable (hook_blocked)
    I-->>C: 422 {error: "content_blocked", reason}
  else action == "override"
    CE->>CE: Replace message content with modified_content
  end

  CE->>DB: Persist message (conv_id, role: user, content, attachments[])
  CE->>CE: Orchestration: detect attachment requires ingestion
  CE->>JM: Request job: file_ingestion(file_id, tenant_id, message_id)
  JM-->>CE: job_id (status: queued)
  CE->>DB: Update message.job_id = job_id
  CE->>EB: Publish event: chat.message.created {message_id, job_id}
  CE-->>I: {message_id, job_id, status: "processing"}
  I-->>C: 201 Created {message_id, job_id, status: "processing"}

  Note over C,JM: [ ] p3 - Step 1c: UI tracks job progress (SSE preferred)
  C->>I: GET /jobs/v1/{job_id}/stream (Accept: text/event-stream)
  I->>JM: Subscribe to job progress (SecurityContext, job_id)
  loop Job progress events
    JM-->>I: SSE: {status: "queued" | "parsing" | "chunking" | "embedding" | "indexing"}
    I-->>C: SSE: {status, progress_pct, details}
  end
  JM-->>I: SSE: {status: "done", doc_id, chunk_count}
  I-->>C: SSE: {status: "done", doc_id}
  Note over C: UI now knows file is ready for RAG retrieval
```

### Step 2/6 - File ingestion pipeline (background job)

 The **Jobs Manager** executes the file ingestion pipeline asynchronously, emitting progress events for UI tracking. When complete, **Chat Engine** proceeds with RAG retrieval.

```mermaid

  box "CyberFabric"

    participant LLM as LLM Gateway (embeddings)
    participant LSI as Local Search Index
    participant EB as Events Broker
    participant CE as Chat Engine
    participant RAG as RAG Gateway
  end

  Note over JM,FP: [ ] p2 - Background job execution (p2: progress events)
  JM->>JM: Dequeue job: file_ingestion(file_id)
  JM->>EB: Emit progress: {status: "parsing"}
  JM->>FS: Fetch file bytes (file_id)
  FS-->>JM: File content stream
  JM->>FP: Parse file (mime_type, content)
  FP-->>JM: Parsed result {text, metadata, structure}

  Note over JM,HK: [ ] p3 - HOOK: file.post_parse (informative only)
  JM->>HK: Invoke hook (file.post_parse, {file_id, parsed_text, metadata})
  Note right of JM: Informative hook - cannot block or override

  Note over JM,LSI: [ ] p2 - Chunking + embedding + indexing

  JM->>EB: Emit progress: {status: "embedding"}
  JM->>LLM: Generate embeddings (chunks[])
  LLM-->>JM: vectors[]
  JM->>EB: Emit progress: {status: "indexing"}
  JM->>LSI: Index chunks (tenant_id, doc_id, chunks[], vectors[])
  LSI-->>JM: indexed_count
  JM->>JM: Update job status: done
  JM->>EB: Emit progress: {status: "done", doc_id, chunk_count}

  Note over CE,RAG: [ ] p2 - Chat Engine proceeds with RAG retrieval
  EB-->>CE: Event: file.ingestion.completed {message_id, doc_id}

```

### Step 3/6 - RAG retrieval from indexed documents

Retrieve relevant context from indexed documents using hybrid search (vector + keyword).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  box "CyberFabric"
    participant CE as Chat Engine
    participant SET as Settings Service
    participant HK as Hook invocation
    participant RAG as RAG Gateway
    participant LSI as Local Search Index
  end

  Note over CE,SET: [ ] p1 - Load user/tenant configuration
  CE->>SET: Get settings (tenant_id, user_id)
  SET-->>CE: {enabled_tool_ids[], model_policy, agent_config, websearch_enabled}

  Note over CE,RAG: [ ] p2 - RAG retrieval with hooks
  CE->>CE: Build search query from user message

  Note over CE,HK: [ ] p3 - HOOK: search.pre_request (RAG)
  CE->>HK: Invoke hook (search.pre_request, {query, search_type: "rag"})
  HK-->>CE: {action: allow | block | override}
  alt action == "block"
    CE->>CE: Skip RAG retrieval (or return error)
  else action == "override"
    CE->>CE: Use modified query
  end

  CE->>RAG: Retrieve context (query, filters: {doc_id})
  RAG->>LSI: Hybrid search (vector + keyword, tenant_id)
  LSI-->>RAG: Top-K chunks with scores
  RAG->>RAG: Rerank + deduplicate + format citations
  RAG-->>CE: ContextPack {chunks[], citations[], token_count}

  Note over CE,HK: [ ] p3 - HOOK: search.post_response (RAG)
  CE->>HK: Invoke hook (search.post_response, {chunks[], citations[]})
  HK-->>CE: {action: allow | block | override}
  alt action == "override"
    CE->>CE: Use modified chunks/citations
  end
```

### Step 4/6 - WebSearch for real-time information (if enabled)

When WebSearch is enabled, query external search engines for real-time information. Results are merged with RAG context.

**WebSearch best practices:**
- Query rewriting (LLM-assisted or rule-based)
- Result deduplication with RAG context
- Source URL attribution for citations

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  box "CyberFabric"
    participant CE as Chat Engine
    participant HK as Hook invocation
    participant WS as Web Search Gateway
  end

  Note over CE,WS: [ ] p4 - WebSearch (if enabled)
  alt websearch_enabled == true
    CE->>CE: Rewrite query for web search (LLM-assisted or rule-based)

    Note over CE,HK: [ ] p5 - HOOK: search.pre_request (WebSearch)
    CE->>HK: Invoke hook (search.pre_request, {query, search_type: "web"})
    HK-->>CE: {action: allow | block | override}
    alt action == "block"
      CE->>CE: Skip WebSearch
    else action == "override"
      CE->>CE: Use modified query
    end

    CE->>WS: Search web (query, max_results, safe_search)
    WS-->>CE: WebResults[] {title, url, snippet, published_date}

    Note over CE,HK: [ ] p5 - HOOK: search.post_response (WebSearch)
    CE->>HK: Invoke hook (search.post_response, {web_results[]})
    HK-->>CE: {action: allow | block | override}
    alt action == "override"
      CE->>CE: Use filtered/modified results
    end

    CE->>CE: Deduplicate + merge with RAG context
    CE->>CE: Format web citations with source URLs
  end
```

### Step 5/6 - Agent state preparation (tools + prompt + model + token budget)

Prepare the full agent state before LLM invocation.

**Key rules:**
- **No runtime tool validation** via MCP (too slow) — rely on GTS-registered definitions
- **Token budget check** before LLM call — reject or mitigate if context too large

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  box "CyberFabric"
    participant CE as Chat Engine
    participant TR as Types Registry
    participant PR as Prompts Registry
    participant MR as Models Registry
    participant AM as Agent Memory
    participant UT as Usage Collector
  end

  Note over CE,TR: [ ] p4 - Resolve tool definitions from GTS (no MCP validation)
  CE->>TR: GET /types/v1/instances?$filter=type_id eq 'gts.x.genai.mcp.tools.v1~*'
  Note right of CE: Filter by enabled_tool_ids from settings
  TR-->>CE: Tool definitions[] {id, schema, mcp_server_uri, auth_config}
  CE->>CE: Use GTS-registered tools directly (trust registration)

  Note over CE,PR: [ ] p1 - Resolve prompt configuration
  CE->>PR: Get prompt (conversation.agent_type, tenant_id)
  PR-->>CE: {system_prompt, tool_usage_instructions, output_format}

  Note over CE,MR: [ ] p1 - Select model
  CE->>MR: Get model (model_policy, required_capabilities: [tools, streaming])
  MR-->>CE: {model_id, provider, context_window, supports_tools}

  Note over CE,AM: [ ] p5 - Load agent memory (optional)
  CE->>AM: Get relevant memories (user_id, conversation_id)
  AM-->>CE: Memory entries[] (episodic, semantic)

  Note over CE,CE: [ ] p3 - TOKEN BUDGET CHECK (critical for production)
  CE->>CE: Calculate prompt_tokens = system_prompt + history + RAG_context + web_context + tool_schemas
  CE->>CE: remaining_tokens = context_window - prompt_tokens
  alt remaining_tokens < min_required (e.g., 500)
    CE->>CE: Apply mitigation strategy
    alt Strategy: summarize history
      CE->>CE: Compress older messages to summary
    else Strategy: reduce RAG context
      CE->>CE: Keep only top-K most relevant chunks
    else Strategy: shrink tool descriptors
      CE->>CE: Use compact tool descriptions
    else No mitigation possible
      CE-->>CE: Reject with error: "Context too large"
    end
  end

  CE->>UT: Check user/tenant token budget remaining
  UT-->>CE: {budget_remaining, budget_limit}
  alt budget_remaining <= 0
    CE-->>CE: Reject with error: "Token budget exceeded"
  end

  CE->>CE: Build AgentState {messages[], tools[], rag_context, web_context, memory, model, token_budget}
```

### Step 6/6 - ReAct agent loop + SSE streaming

This implements the **ReAct pattern** (Reason + Act): the agent iteratively calls the LLM, executes any requested tools, and feeds results back until the LLM produces a final answer.

    alt action == "block"
      CE->>CE: Abort agent loop
      CE-->>CE: Return error: {code: "llm_call_blocked", reason}
    else action == "override"
      CE->>CE: Use modified messages/tools
    end

#### SSE streaming with throttling (continuation of Step 6/6)

The final answer is streamed to the client using **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**. The Chat engine uses ModKit's `SseBroadcaster` for efficient fan-out.

**Key rules:**
- **SSE throttling**: If user/tenant consumes too many tokens, slow down or terminate stream
- Track token budget in real-time during streaming

## Typical chat scenario with SYNCHRONOUS file attachment w/o RAG and WebSearch processing

This is a **simpler** alternative version of the async scenario:
- **No Jobs Manager** — file is parsed immediately during the request
- **No RAG** — file content is injected directly into chat context
- **No WebSearch** — no external search engines are used
- Aligned with current Go implementation (`/chat/threads/{thread_id}/attachment` and `/chat/attachments`)

**Steps:**
1. User uploads file → synchronous parse → create "file attachment message" — **Hook: file.post_parse**
2. User sends message — **Hook: user_message.pre_store**
3. Prepare agent state + agent loop + SSE streaming — **Hooks: llm.pre_call, llm.post_response** (same as async Steps 5-6)

### Step 1/3 - Upload file + synchronous parse + create attachment message

File is uploaded, parsed immediately (using File Parser), and a **file attachment message** is created with the parsed/truncated content. No background job, no RAG indexing, no WebSearch.

```mermaid

  autonumber
  participant U as User
  participant C as Client UI

  box "CyberFabric"
    participant I as API gateway
    participant CE as Chat engine
    participant FP as File parser gateway
    participant HK as Hook invocation
    participant DB as Chat DB
    participant AUD as Audit
  end

  U->>C: Attach file + type message

  Note over C,CE: [ ] p1 - Option A: Upload to existing thread
  C->>I: POST /chat/v1/threads/{thread_id}/attachment (multipart)
  I->>CE: Handle attachment upload (SecurityContext, thread_id, file)

  Note over CE,FP: [ ] p1 - Synchronous file parsing
  CE->>CE: Validate file size (max_size_kb from config)
  CE->>FP: Parse file (mime_type, content)
  FP-->>CE: Parsed result {text, metadata}

  Note over CE,HK: [ ] p3 - HOOK: file.post_parse (informative)
  CE->>HK: Invoke hook (file.post_parse, {file_id, parsed_text, metadata})
  Note right of CE: Informative hook - cannot block or override

  Note over CE,CE: [ ] p1 - Apply content limits
  CE->>CE: Check content length vs max_content_length
  alt Content too large
    CE->>CE: Truncate at whitespace boundary
    CE->>CE: Mark as truncated (preserve metadata)
  end

  Note over CE,DB: [ ] p1 - Create file attachment message
  CE->>DB: Insert message (thread_id, role: "file_attachment")
  Note right of CE: {content: formatted_text, filename, file_ext, original_size, is_truncated}
  CE->>AUD: Audit: chat.attachment.created {thread_id, filename, size}
  CE-->>I: {message_id, thread_id, content_length, is_truncated}
  I-->>C: 201 Created {message_id, is_truncated}

  Note over C,CE: [ ] p1 - Option B: Create new thread with attachment
  C->>I: POST /chat/v1/attachments (multipart, ?group_id)
  I->>CE: Create thread + attachment (SecurityContext, group_id?, file)
  CE->>DB: Create new thread (group_id)
  CE->>FP: Parse file (same as above)
  FP-->>CE: Parsed result
  CE->>HK: [ ] p3 - HOOK: file.post_parse (informative)
  CE->>CE: Apply content limits (same as above)
  CE->>DB: Insert file attachment message
  CE-->>I: {message_id, thread_id, content_length, is_truncated}
  I-->>C: 201 Created {message_id, thread_id}

  Note over C: UI can now send user message referencing this thread
```

### Step 2/3 - Send user message + prepare agent state

After the file attachment message exists, user sends their actual question. Chat Engine prepares agent state with file content included in context.

  participant C as Client UI

  box "CyberFabric"
    participant I as API Gateway
    participant CE as Chat Engine
    participant HK as Hook invocation

    participant TR as Types Registry
    participant PR as Prompts Registry
    participant MR as Models Registry
    participant UT as Usage Collector
  end

  Note over C,CE: [ ] p1 - User sends message
  C->>I: POST /chat/v1/threads/{thread_id}/messages
  Note right of C: {content: "Summarize this document", model_name, stream: true}
  I->>CE: Create user message (SecurityContext)

  Note over CE,HK: [ ] p3 - HOOK: user_message.pre_store
  CE->>HK: Invoke hook (user_message.pre_store, {content, attachments})
  HK-->>CE: {action: allow | block | override}
  alt action == "block"
    CE-->>I: 422 Unprocessable (hook_blocked)
    I-->>C: 422 {error: "content_blocked", reason}
  else action == "override"
    CE->>CE: Replace message content with modified_content
  end

  CE->>DB: Persist user message

  Note over CE,DB: [ ] p1 - Load conversation context (including file attachment)
  CE->>DB: Get thread messages (thread_id)
  DB-->>CE: messages[] including file_attachment_message

  Note over CE,SET: [ ] p1 - Load settings (p2: tools)
  CE->>SET: Get settings (tenant_id, user_id)
  SET-->>CE: {enabled_tool_ids[], model_policy}
  CE->>TR: [ ] p2 - GET tool definitions (gts.x.genai.mcp.tools.v1~*)
  TR-->>CE: Tool definitions[] (no runtime validation)

  Note over CE,PR: [ ] p1 - Resolve prompt + model
  CE->>PR: Get prompt (agent_type, tenant_id)
  PR-->>CE: {system_prompt}
  CE->>MR: Get model (model_policy)
  MR-->>CE: {model_id, context_window}

  Note over CE,CE: [ ] p2 - TOKEN BUDGET CHECK (critical for production)
  CE->>CE: prompt_tokens = system_prompt + file_content + history + tool_schemas
  CE->>CE: remaining_tokens = context_window - prompt_tokens
  alt remaining_tokens < min_required
    alt File content too large
      CE->>CE: Truncate file content further
    else History too long
      CE->>CE: Summarize older messages
    else Still too large
      CE-->>I: Error: "Context exceeds model limit"
      I-->>C: 400 Bad Request
    end
  end

  CE->>UT: Check token budget
  UT-->>CE: {budget_remaining}
  alt budget_remaining <= 0
    CE-->>I: Error: "Token budget exceeded"
    I-->>C: 402 Payment Required
  end

  CE->>CE: Build AgentState {messages[], tools[], model, token_budget}
```

### Step 3/3 - Agent loop + SSE streaming (same as async Step 6/6)

For the agent loop and SSE streaming, refer to the **async scenario Step 6/6** above. The flow is identical:
1. ReAct agent loop (LLM call → tool execution → repeat)
2. SSE streaming with throttling

The only difference is that the context includes the **full file attachment content** (possibly truncated) directly in messages, rather than RAG-retrieved chunks with citations.
