///   <https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program>
///   for the cert matching the running macOS version. TLS 1.2 cipher suites
///   are excluded under `fips` because Apple does not expose a separately
///   CAVS-validated TLS PRF primitive (unlike aws-lc-fips on Linux); see
///   the `cyberware-rustls-corecrypto-provider` README "FIPS claim boundaries"
///   section. On macOS the `rustls/fips` feature is not activated (see
///   `rustls-fips-shim`), so the AWS-LC FIPS dylib is not linked.
/// - **`fips` feature + Windows**: installs the Windows CNG-backed provider
///   from `rustls-cng-crypto`'s `fips_provider()`. CNG is shipped inside
///   Windows and validated by Microsoft under FIPS 140-3 per OS release.
///   Requires Windows to be in system-wide FIPS mode
///   (`HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\FipsAlgorithmPolicy = 1`,
///   set via Group Policy); fails closed with
///   [`CryptoProviderError::SystemFipsModeNotEnabled`] otherwise. As with
///   macOS, `rustls/fips` is not activated on this target, so the AWS-LC
///   FIPS dylib is not linked.
/// - **`fips` feature + other** (Linux, etc.): installs the FIPS-validated
///   AWS-LC provider (`aws-lc-fips-sys`, NIST Certificate #4816). The cert's
///   OE covers Linux but not Darwin/Windows, which is why those targets use
///   different providers.
/// - **Standard mode** (no `fips` feature): installs the `aws-lc-rs` provider
///   explicitly. This is required because both `ring` and `aws-lc-rs` are
///   compiled into the binary (ring via `aliri`/`pingora-rustls`), and rustls
///   0.23 panics when it cannot auto-detect a single provider. Conflicts here
///   are non-fatal: if another provider was installed first, it stays active,
///   the conflict is logged at `warn!`, and `Ok(())` is returned.
///
/// This **must** be called before any TLS configuration, HTTP client, database
/// connection, or JWT operation is created.
///
/// Safe to call multiple times -- only the first invocation has an effect;
/// subsequent calls return the cached first-call result.
///
/// # FIPS-claim caveats
///
/// On the resulting provider, `provider.fips() == true` is a **runtime
/// witness** under the witness-pattern rework — it is `true` only when both
/// (a) every primitive routes through a CMVP-validated module *and* (b)
/// the runtime OE check agrees. It is no longer an unconditional design-
/// intent claim.
///
/// **macOS**: the corecrypto crate runs an OE check at first provider
/// construction (`cyberware_rustls_corecrypto_provider::oe::fips_witness_ok`).
/// On a macOS major outside the active corecrypto CMVP cert OE, **every**
/// `fips()` impl in the provider returns `false` and a single
/// `tracing::warn!` is emitted. There is **no panic** — downstream code
/// that depends on `ClientConfig::fips()` / `ServerConfig::fips()` must
/// handle the `false` case explicitly (see
/// `modkit_http::tls::apply_fips_hardening` for the canonical pattern,
/// which returns `Err` instead of asserting). The
/// `CYBERWARE_FIPS_OE_OVERRIDE=1` env-var forces the witness to `true`
/// for CI on pre-release macOS — never for production. See the
/// `cyberware-rustls-corecrypto-provider` README "Runtime FIPS witness" section
/// and FIPS PRD §8.3.
///
/// **Linux / Windows**: runtime OE-validation is not yet implemented; OE
/// coverage is verified via the release checklist (manual CMVP cert search,
/// PRD §9.3). Tracked as a follow-up in PRD §10.
///
/// # Errors

/// - [`CryptoProviderError::FipsProviderConflict`] if the `fips` feature is
///   enabled and another rustls provider was installed first.
/// - [`CryptoProviderError::SystemFipsModeNotEnabled`] on Windows+`fips` when
