//! Background lifecycle & cleanup engine -- orphan reconciliation, retention-policy
//! expiry, and per-instance sweep scheduling.
//!
//! `CleanupEngine::run_sweep` is the single entry point for the cleanup cycle.
//! It is intentionally best-effort: one step's failure does not abort the rest.
//! Errors are logged at `warn` level rather than propagated.
//!
//! **No cross-instance coordination in P2.** The sweep runs independently on
//! every control-plane instance. Because all operations are idempotent (delete
//! is no-op when the row is already gone; audit rows are inserted transactionally
//! only when a row is deleted) concurrent sweeps on the same data are safe, just
//! redundant. Leader election / distributed locking is deferred to P3.
