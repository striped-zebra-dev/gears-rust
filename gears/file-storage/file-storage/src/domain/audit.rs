//! Transactional-outbox domain records for the file-storage gear.
//!
//! An [`AuditEntry`] is inserted into the `audit_outbox` table, and a
//! [`FileEvent`] into the `events_outbox` table, in the **same DB transaction**
//! as every write mutation, guaranteeing 100% coverage with no silent drops
//! (the transactional-outbox pattern). Both are pure domain records: the
//! control-plane services build them and hand them to the [`Store`] facade,
//! which persists them — so neither the services nor the store depend on the
//! persistence repo layer for these types.
//!
//! [`Store`]: crate::infra::storage::Store
